## Installation

Nothing extra required other than a current Python3 installation with standard libraries installed. Utilizes sys, argparse, ipaddress, and random modules.

## Usage example

If you have chmod'd the script to +x:
```
netexpand.py 192.168.1.0/30
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
```
Otherwise:
```
python3 netexpand.py 192.168.1.0/30 -r
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.1
```

## Development setup

Same as install, nothing special here. Just need a working Python3 install, with sys and argparse modules.

## Release History

* 0.0.0
    * Working on README, LICENSE, and deciding on best commandline argument parser for python.
